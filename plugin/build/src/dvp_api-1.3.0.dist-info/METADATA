# Delphix Virtualization Platform API

This API helps developers build plugins to ingest and provision data on top of the Delphix Virtualization Platform.
The API is fully generated based on protobuf definitions. Currently, plugin developers are not expected to work directly
against this API but instead use the Virtualization SDK that makes creation of platform plugins easy. For details on the
Virtualization SDK, please refer to its [documentation](https://developer.delphix.com/).
